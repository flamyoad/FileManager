Sample repo to demonstrate multi-module
- Interface / Implementation module
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Hilt for DI
- Dependency management with `buildSrc` and kotlin DSL
  - Using [toml](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs) might be better, so it doesn't trigger prompt to Gradle sync on each edit :)
- todo todo
